# Auto eMails

While working for a company as a sales assistant I noticed that I could automate the process of sending emails and thus save time using the cold email marketing strategy.
I discovered there are a lot of tools that send all of the emails at once. However, most email services have algorithms that detect spam behaviour. In this case, sending a huge amount of emails at once. This results in many targeted emails that land in the spam folder. The company decided to send the emails manually to ensure that the recipient will receive the mail in his inbox. 
This was time-consuming so I decided to write a small Python program that takes in sender details, an email list and the content of the message. It creates packages of emails and sends them separately with a break in between. This ensures that the recipient receives the mail in his main inbox.
The program was written in November 2020 and has been used ever since by the company. In time it was updated with additional features.

Notes:
-	The uploaded program does not include instructions on how to use it
-	The program is written with Slovenian comments.
